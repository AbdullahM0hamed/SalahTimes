<strong><i>An android app which helps a Muslim keep track of the times of Salah</i></strong>
</div>

## Salah Times
This is a simple android app intended to help Muslims keep track of the times of salah, whilst also being open-source so Muslims can feel comfortable letting this app use their location data.

## Planned Features - CheckList
This app is not yet complete enough (in my opinion) for release. Here is a list of features that I want done, and whether or not they are complete.

- [x] Calculate Salah Times
  - [x] Make calculation method configurable
  - [x] Calculate times for other days, so users can check ahead of time if they wish
- [ ] Notify the user when it is time for Salah. This is the main feature I would like to fix before releasing the app
- [ ] - Have a functioning Qiblah compass
  - [x] - Provide a fallback for users who do not have the necessary sensors to allow for a working compass, using the sun as a reference. Unfortunately, I am one of these people and need help testing any code I will have to write for a functioning compass.
- [ ] A widget for Salah Times
- [ ] A widget that shows the Hijri date
- [ ] A comprehensive theme engine (I'm an advocate of choice when it comes to app aesthetics)

## Screenshots

The following screenshots showcase the app is it right now, and may change in the near-future.
